### Command_Line_For_The_Win Readme

**Here are the steps to use the SFTP command-line tool:**

1. I Took the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.
2. I opened a git bash terminal.
3. I used the hostname, username, and password provided for the sandbox environment to establish a connection between SFTP command-line tool  and the sandbox environment.
4. Once connected, I navigated to the command_line_for_the_win directory where I want to upload the screenshots.
5. I used the SFTP put *(put /c/Users/USER/Pictures/0-first_9_tasks.png)* command to upload the screenshots from my local machine to the sandbox environment.
6. I confirmed that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
7. Once the screenshots are transferred, I proceeded to push the screenshots to my GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.

This will help the reviewers understand how I performed the file transfer using SFTP.
